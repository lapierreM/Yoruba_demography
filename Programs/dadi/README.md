This folder contains the programs in Python to reproduce the results concerning the dadi method (Gutenkunst et al. 2009). All details and parameter values are explained in the comments of the programs.

`make_dadi_fs.py`: outputs a file containing the SFS to fit with dadi, in the right format for dadi (see their manual for details)

`dadi_exponential_growth.py`: dadi program to fit the observed SFS with an exponential growth demography

`dadi_linear_growth.py`: dadi program to fit the observed SFS with a linear growth demography

`dadi_sudden_growth.py`: dadi program to fit the observed SFS with a sudden growth demography
