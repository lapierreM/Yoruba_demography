This folder contains examples of output files for the programs.

- 3 outputs of the SFS_fitting.py program :
	* example_FoldSFS_YRI.txt.fit: values of d (least square distance) between observed Yoruba SFS and the five models depending on parameter t value

	* example_FoldSFS_YRI.txt.models: minimum values of d (least square distance) between observed Yoruba SFS and the five models for the optimized parameter t value (given between parenthesis). The third line gives the total inferred tree length for the Kingman derived models. 

	* example_FoldSFS_YRI.txt.bestfit: bestfit SFS under the five models, observed SFS and standard Kingman SFS. The first column gives the SFS bin index. SFS are normalized.

- example_Conditioned_trajectory.txt: trajectory of fixation under the Conditioned model, output from the Conditioned_trajectory.py program. First column gives time and second columns gives the mean frequency of the allele.
